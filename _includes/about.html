      I’m a software developer working out of my home office in Des Moines, IA,
      with a degree in Computer Science from Iowa State University. My tech
      stack ranges across many languages, but the avenues in which I am most
      experienced are developing applications for web with Node.js, and
      designing user interfaces. Some of my work includes projects for John
      Deere, where I helped develop websites that connect farmers with their
      telemetric data, and present it in digestible graphics and charts within
      Deere’s suite of interactive applications for agriculture and construction
      (such as Property Center and JDLink). I’ve also worked with Iowa’s
      Institute for Transportation to develop a GIS application for the pavement
      needs of local municipalities; and in my free time, I maintain a
      multiplayer HTML5 game – with graphics rendered with PixiJS, and server
      connectivity built with socket.io.

    I enjoy the problem-solving nature of programming, and often times a feature
    or application idea, which at first seems too complex or impossible, is only
    overwhelming at first sight. Through patience and perseverance, assuming
    there is a good modular understanding of the project architecture, many
    problems will find solutions after steady work and rigorous research.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    When beginning a new project, I like to look around and research the latest
    technology that would best fit the current need of the client and the
    intention behind the application proposal. Technologies change and update so
    fast, especially in web development, that often times what would be the most
    fitting tool for a given feature – ie testing, or styling React components –
    might have already been replaced by another library or standard.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    When encountering an old project, I make sure that I understand the root
    design first, and only then modify or add additional features. Through my
    experience working on repositories which are sourced from a wide net of
    developers and their software strategies, there is never an application
    without some level of tech debt. Thus working through any code work is
    always a struggle between releasing the new feature, and cleaning up the
    existing codebase – for node apps and deployment, eslint rules are very
    helpful to prune the worst of messy code. Test driven development (through
    Jest or mocha), though it often adds many hours of development work, also
    serves to double-check every change before releasing to production, and can
    be very insightful if anything in the application crashes, or some internal
    function fails.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moving forward, I hope to expand my experience and contribute to projects
    which provide a positive world impact. I’m always open to working with new
    technologies and exploring new fields of computer science, while also
    building upon what I know.
